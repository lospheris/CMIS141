The primary purpose here is for me to work with and play around with the things that I am learning during week 2 
of the course.
The credit for the code here goes primarily to the book: Introduction to Java Programming Comprehensive Version Eighth Edition Y. Daniel Liang International Edition Published by Pearson
Any code that isn't from the book will be from the instructor: Ms. Nafia Filiz Güngördü
I wont be explicitly citing code from those to places since it would be counterproductive to what I am trying to do. If I 
happen to get anything from anywhere else I will cite it accordingly.
